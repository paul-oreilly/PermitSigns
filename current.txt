Sign type ideas: 
 
PricePreview 
Show's what a permit will cost
Usage: Outside a "Temple of doom" to avoid players getting to the end.. and not having enough money!
 
Sale
Shows what a permit will cost, allows player to buy permit
Usage: Player right clicks sign, buys permit
 
Role
Shows permit name, and number remaining. Number is a count down
Usage: Arena's, for classes etc.
 
Monitor
Shows the number of people with the given permit
Usage: Arena spectator area, mod room etc.
 
 
 
Sign names:
Config should have options for what each sign type is called (top label, eg [Knowledge] vs [Sale])
 
Sign data:
Signs are tied to a permit alias in the backend. (So they don't need to be location aware for operation, but
  will need to be for setup)
  
Sign creation:
Ideally, a command "/permitme sign create alias [worldguard alias]" and punch the sign
To help, "/permitme sign location [most of alias]" then "/permitme sign create id [uid]"

Pricing for sales signs:
Have a wide range of pricing methods, and multiple pricing methods can be active on one sign.
Have a min, max and base price.
Pricing decay means a drop over time, using a "every minute" function, can be set amount, or ratio
Pricing should have a rounding factor - use "multiple of x" (eg 100, 25, or .5) and only update when this changes
Pricing factor means an increase in price whenever a player purchases this permit (from anywhere) - tracked with seperate "factor Price"
pricing ratio (can be many) means this may raise or lower in price depending on the raio of this permit to another
