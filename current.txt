Pricing for sales signs:
Have a wide range of pricing methods, and multiple pricing methods can be active on one sign.
Have a min, max and base price.
Pricing decay means a drop over time, using a "every minute" function, can be set amount, or ratio
Pricing should have a rounding factor - use "multiple of x" (eg 100, 25, or .5) and only update when this changes
Pricing factor means an increase in price whenever a player purchases this permit (from anywhere) - tracked with seperate "factor Price"
pricing ratio (can be many) means this may raise or lower in price depending on the raio of this permit to another
